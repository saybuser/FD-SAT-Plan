# FD-SAT-Plan

Factored Deep SAT Planner (FD-SAT-Plan) [1] is a two-stage planner based on the learning and planning framework [2] that (i) learns the state transition function T(s<sub>t</sub>,a<sub>t</sub>) = s<sub>t+1</sub> of a factored [3] planning problem using Binarized Neural Networks [4] from data, and (ii) compiles multiple copies of the learned transition function T'(...T'(T'(T'(I,a<sub>0</sub>),a<sub>1</sub>),a<sub>2</sub>)...) = G (as visualized by Figure 1) into CNF and solves it using off-the-shelf SAT solver [5,6]. FD-SAT-Plan can handle both discrete and continuous action/state spaces, arbitrarily complex state transition functions, pseudo-boolean constraints on actions/states and pseudo-boolean reward functions.

## Improvements

I always look for ways to improve the runtime performance and memory efficiency of FD-SAT-Plan. Since the publication [1], the performance of FD-SAT-Plan has significantly (1-2 orders of magnitude!) improved due to more compact encodings of the binarized activation functions. Namely: 

i) cardinality networks [7] with bi-directional clauses are currently used to replace the sequential cardinality [8] constraints used in [1]. Similar to [9], the cardinality constraints are conjoined with equivalence constraints (Note that [9] uses sequential counters [8] with O(nk) variables and clauses instead of cardinality networks [7] with O(nlog<sub>2</sub>k<sup>2</sup>) variables and clauses). 

ii) cardinality constraints (i.e., sum<sub>1..i..n</sub> x<sub>i</sub> >= k) are 'flipped' (i.e., sum<sub>1..i..n</sub> -x<sub>i</sub> <= n-k) when k > n/2.

Moreover, FD-SAT-Plan

iii) includes parsers for domain files that read in pseudo-boolean expressions of form: sum<sub>1..i..n</sub> x<sub>i</sub> <= k. See translation folder for more details.

iv) handles reward functions and can call any off-the-shelf Weighted Partial MaxSat solver.

v) can make use of known transition functions (i.e., the transition function for a subset of state variables can be provided as input - see Inventory Control example).

## Dependencies

i) Data collection (input to training BNN [4]): Data is collected using the RDDL-based domain simulator [10]. 

ii) Training BNN: The toolkit [11] is used to train BNNs. The final training parameters were recorded into bnn.txt and normalization.txt files.

iii) Compilation to CNF: The toolkit [12] is called in fd_sat_plan.py to write the list of literals into the DIMACS CNF format.

iv) Solver: Any off-the-shelf SAT solver or Weighted Partial MaxSat works. In our paper [1], we used Glucose SAT solver [5]. For FD-SAT-Plan+ (i.e., with reward considerations) Weighted Partial MaxSat solver[6] is used.

For i) any domain simulator and for ii) any BNN training toolkit works. Example bnn.txt, normalization.txt and domain files (under translation folder) are provided for navigation, inventory and sysadmin domains. Therefore to run the planner, you will only need iii) and iv).

## Running FD-SAT-Plan

fd_sat_plan.py -d domain -i instance -h horizon -o optimize

Example: python fd_sat_plan.py -d navigation -i 3x3 -h 4 -o False

## Verification Task

FD-SAT-Plan can also be used to verify different properties of BNNs by setting horizon -h to 1.

## Known Limitations

i) Input files in translation folder only accepts pseudo-boolean constraints/expressions in the form of: sum<sub>1..i..n</sub> x<sub>i</sub> ? k where ? can be <=, >= or ==.
